# testconfigreactbot

## Goal
The aim of this repo is to have a functioning Discord bot that does the following:
- Allow the end user to login to a web dashboard using Discord;
- Allow the end user configure various settings via a per-guild YAML config on the web dashboard;
- Allow the end user to view a guild overview on the web dashboard; and
- Implement some basic Discord bot commands to demonstrate the configuration.

This is for me to learn the following:
- YAML with Node.js, it uses YAML so it's user-friendly, but it should be stored as JSON; and
- React with React-Router.
